## Data

First, we will read in the MISR datasets which have been matched to the AQS and CSN datasets. These data were matched spatially by considering every AQS/CSN data collection site within a 2.2 km radius of a MISR data pixel, and these matches were further filtered by matching these observations based on the dates when they were recorded.

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
MISR_AQS <- read_csv(paste0(getwd(), "/Data/MISR/MISR_merged_data/MISR_AQS_Matched.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
MISR_CSN <- read_csv(paste0(getwd(), "/Data/MISR/MISR_merged_data/MISR_CSN_Matched.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
```

In addition to the data which we collected from the CSN dataset, we will also use a formula to estimate the total dust mass in a given area, based on the presence of certain elements.

The formula to compute dust mass is given by $\text{Dust Mass} = 2.2\times\text{Al} + 2.49\times\text{Si} + 1.63\times\text{Ca} + 1.94\times\text{Ti} + 2.42\times\text{Fe}$.

```{r compute-dust-mass, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
MISR_CSN <- MISR_CSN %>% 
  mutate(Dust = 2.2*Al + 2.49*Si + 1.63*Ca + 1.94*Ti + 2.42*Fe) %>%
  relocate(Dust, .after = sulfate)
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

First, we will do some exploratory data analysis for these datasets, so we can have a better understanding of the data which we collected.

### Numerical Summaries

We will examine some brief numerical summaries of our main four variables, in order to know more about their general distributions.

```{r numerical-summaries, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Function to create a numerical summary of a numeric vector
# The summary includes a 5-number summary, IQR, range, mean, standard deviation,
# number of missing and number of present observations
numSum <- function(vect){
  recorded = na.omit(vect)
  num_summary <- c(min(recorded), quantile(recorded, 0.25), median(recorded), quantile(recorded, 0.75),
                   max(recorded), IQR(recorded), max(recorded) - min(recorded), mean(recorded), 
                   sd(recorded), length(recorded), length(vect) - length(recorded))
  num_summary <- unname(num_summary)
  names(num_summary) <- c("Minimum", "25th percentile", "Median", "75th percentile", "Maximum", 
                          "IQR", "Range", "Mean", "Standard Deviation", "Present Values", "Missing Values")
  return(num_summary)
}

dust_summary <- numSum(MISR_CSN$Dust)
nitrate_summary <- numSum(MISR_CSN$nitrate)
sulfate_summary <- numSum(MISR_CSN$sulfate)
pm25_summary <- numSum(MISR_AQS$PM25)

var_summaries <- rbind(dust_summary, nitrate_summary, sulfate_summary, pm25_summary)
rownames(var_summaries) <- c("Dust Mass", "Nitrate", "Sulfate", "PM2.5")

knitr::kable(round(var_summaries, 4), caption = "Numerical Summaries of the variables we want to predict") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"))
```

Based on the table above, we see that there are a few negative values recorded for Dust Mass and PM2.5 concentrations. As a concentration must be strictly non-negative (as we cannot have negative amounts of a particle), we will replace all negative values with 0.

```{r remove-negatives, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
MISR_AQS <- MISR_AQS %>% 
  mutate(PM25 = replace(PM25, which(PM25 < 0), 0))

MISR_CSN <- MISR_CSN %>%
  mutate(Dust = replace(Dust, which(Dust < 0), 0))
```

### Histograms

In addition to examining numerical summaries of these values, we will also examine histograms of the values to see the overall distributions of these variables in a more visual manner.

```{r dust-mass-histograms, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.dim = c(8, 10)}
dust_histogram <- MISR_CSN %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Dust)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "black", fill = "grey") +
  labs(x = "Dust Mass", y = "Count", title = "Counts of Dust Masses in Merged MISR/CSN Dataset",
       subtitle = "Data collected in California from February 2000 to March 2022") +
  theme_bw()

dust_log_histogram <- MISR_CSN %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(Dust + 0.001, base = 10))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "black", fill = "grey") +
  labs(x = "log(Dust Mass)", y = "Count", title = "Counts of Dust Masses in Merged MISR/CSN Dataset",
       subtitle = "Data collected in California from February 2000 to March 2022") +
  theme_bw()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(dust_histogram, dust_log_histogram)
```

```{r nitrate-mass-histograms, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.dim = c(8, 10)}
nitrate_histogram <- MISR_CSN %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = nitrate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "black", fill = "darkred") +
  labs(x = "Nitrate", y = "Count", title = "Counts of Nitrate (NO3) Concentrations in Merged MISR/CSN Dataset",
       subtitle = "Data collected in California from February 2000 to March 2022") +
  theme_bw()

nitrate_log_histogram <- MISR_CSN %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(nitrate + 0.001, base = 10))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "black", fill = "darkred") +
  labs(x = "Nitrate", y = "Count", title = "Counts of Nitrate (NO3) Concentrations in Merged MISR/CSN Dataset",
       subtitle = "Data collected in California from February 2000 to March 2022") +
  theme_bw()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(nitrate_histogram, nitrate_log_histogram)
```

```{r sulfate-mass-histograms, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.dim = c(8, 10)}
sulfate_histogram <- MISR_CSN %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sulfate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "black", fill = "darkblue") +
  labs(x = "Sulfate", y = "Count", title = "Counts of Sulfate (SO4) Concentrations in Merged MISR/CSN Dataset",
       subtitle = "Data collected in California from February 2000 to March 2022") +
  theme_bw()

sulfate_log_histogram <- MISR_CSN %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(sulfate + 0.001, base = 10))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "black", fill = "darkblue") +
  labs(x = "Sulfate", y = "Count", title = "Counts of Sulfate (SO4) Concentrations in Merged MISR/CSN Dataset",
       subtitle = "Data collected in California from February 2000 to March 2022") +
  theme_bw()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(sulfate_histogram, sulfate_log_histogram)
```

```{r pm25-mass-histograms, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.dim = c(8, 10)}
pm25_histogram <- MISR_AQS %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = PM25)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "black", fill = "green") +
  labs(x = "PM2.5 Mass", y = "Count", title = "Counts of PM2.5 Masses in Merged MISR/AQS Dataset",
       subtitle = "Data collected in California from February 2000 to March 2022") +
  theme_bw()

pm25_log_histogram <- MISR_AQS %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(PM25 + 0.001, base = 10))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "black", fill = "green") +
  labs(x = "PM2.5 Mass", y = "Count", title = "Counts of PM2.5 Masses Concentrations in Merged MISR/AQS Dataset",
       subtitle = "Data collected in California from February 2000 to March 2022") +
  theme_bw()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(pm25_histogram, pm25_log_histogram)
```

From the plots above, we see that the distributions for each of these four variables are all somewhat right-skewed, as there are quite a few high-valued outliers in these datasets, and there are not a corresponding amount of low values in these data, as these data are all strictly non-negative.

The log-plots above all appear to be relatively symmetrical and look somewhat like Normal distributions, which may be helpful for model fitting and prediction purposes, as these distributions are significantly less skewed by their few large values.

### Historical Data

In addition to the histograms which show the general distributions of these data over our 22-year period, we have created time series plots of dust mass, nitrate, PM2.5, and sulfate concentrations in California over time as a way to visualize how these quantities have changed over time. 

The PM2.5 data is sourced from the AQS data collection sites, whereas the dust mass, nitrate, and sulfate concentrations come from the CSN datasets.

### Finding Missing Values

To start off, we will examine counts of missing values in our datasets, to determine how much of the data which we aim to use is actually present in the dataset.

```{r missing-vals-table-1, echo = FALSE}
# Filter merged dataset to only the variables which we needed
MISR_AQS_smaller <- MISR_AQS %>%
  select(Date, PM25, c(12:19), c(37:110))

# Get variable names, and counts of recorded and missing values
MISR_AQS_var_info <- cbind(colnames(MISR_AQS_smaller),
                           colSums(!is.na(MISR_AQS_smaller)),
                           colSums(is.na(MISR_AQS_smaller)))
colnames(MISR_AQS_var_info) <- c("Variable Name", "Recorded Values", "Missing Values")

knitr::kable(MISR_AQS_var_info, row.names = FALSE, caption = "Counts of Variables in the merged MISR and AQS dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE,
                fixed_thead = TRUE) %>%
  scroll_box(height = '500px')
```

First, we notice that there are no missing values for the Date and PM2.5 variables, which is excellent, as these are arguably our two most important variables.

We can also notice that there are the same amount of recorded and missing values for each of the 8 AOD variables. If we examine these 8 variables further, we find that they are a "package deal"; for each observation, there is either a recorded value for all 8 of these variables, or a missing value for all 8 variables.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the 74 AOD mixture variables. From the table above, we can clearly see that the number of available observations varies for each of the 74 mixtures. However, of these 74 mixtures, the mixtures with the fewest number of recorded observations (`aod_mix_71` and `aod_mix_72`) each have `r MISR_AQS_var_info[82, 2]` recorded values. Furthermore, a table containing all 74 mixtures would have `r nrow(drop_na(select(MISR_AQS_smaller, c(1:2, 11:84))))` observations which have a recorded value for each of the 74 mixtures, which is a fair amount of data to work with.

### Charts and Graphs

Next, we will create some charts and plots of the matched MISR data, to get visual representations of the data which we have collected.

First, we will create a "correlation heatmap" to visually depict the correlations between the 74 AOD mixtures which were collected in the MISR data. In the correlation heatmap shown below, the correlations between these different mixtures are measured from -1 to 1, and each square in the heatmap is coloured in, with it's colour and intensity proportional to the correlation between the variables.

![Correlation Heatmap for the 74 MISR Mixtures](C:/Users/johot/Desktop/Joey's Files/Work/NSERC 2022/PM25-Research/Data/MISR_Modelling/Mixtures_Correlation_Heatmap.png)
```{r smallest-mixture-corr, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Read in the csv file containing MISR data
melted_mixture.corr <- read_csv(paste0(getwd(), "/Data/MISR_Modelling/Mixtures_Correlation_Melted.csv"))
smallest_mixture.corr <- melted_mixture.corr %>% 
  filter(value == min(melted_mixture.corr$value))
```

As we can clearly see in the correlation heatmap displayed above, the 74 AOD mixtures in the collected MISR data are all strongly correlated with one another, as the entire heatmap is green. 

In fact, the weakest correlation between a pair of these 74 AOD mixtures is `r smallest_mixture.corr[2,3]`, which is the correlation between `r smallest_mixture.corr[2,1]` and  `r smallest_mixture.corr[2,2]`, which is still considered to be a strong positive linear relationship.

## Model Fitting

Next, we will test a variety of different model fitting techniques on our dataset in order to determine which models are generally more efficient and serve as better models to make predictions for our dataset.

We will create a whole host of different models, as we have multiple different values in these two datasets which we want to predict, and there are multiple different sets of predictors which we aim to incorporate.

The 6 main values which we want to predict are; PM2.5, $\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ (sulfate), $\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$ (nitrate), dust mass, elemental carbon, and organic carbon. The two primary sets of predictors which we want to use are the 8 measured AOD values, and the 74 MISR AOD mixtures.

First, we will split each of our two datasets into a training and a test dataset, with 75% of the data being placed in the training set, and the remaining 25% being put into the validation set.

```{r test-train-PM25, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Select PM2.5 and the 8 AOD parameters from merged AQS/MISR dataset, and drop rows with missing data
PM25_AOD <- MISR_AQS_smaller %>% 
  select(PM25, c(3:10)) %>%
  drop_na()

# Select PM2.5 and the 74 AOD mixtures from merged AQS/MISR dataset, and drop rows with missing data
PM25_mixtures <- MISR_AQS_smaller %>% 
  select(PM25, c(11:84)) %>%
  drop_na()

# Randomly select testing/training datasets for AOD data and 74 mixtures
set.seed(12345)

AOD.train = sample(c(1:nrow(PM25_AOD)), size = floor(0.75 * nrow(PM25_AOD)), replace = FALSE)
AOD.test = setdiff(c(1:nrow(PM25_AOD)), AOD.train)
PM25_AOD.train <- PM25_AOD[AOD.train,]
PM25_AOD.test <- PM25_AOD[AOD.test,]

mixtures.train = sample(c(1:nrow(PM25_mixtures)), size = floor(0.75 * nrow(PM25_mixtures)), replace = FALSE)
mixtures.test = setdiff(c(1:nrow(PM25_mixtures)), mixtures.train)
PM25_mixtures.train <- PM25_mixtures[mixtures.train,]
PM25_mixtures.test <- PM25_mixtures[mixtures.test,]
```


```{r pm25-AOD-xgboost, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Create sets of values to use in xgboosting
eta_vals <- c(0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6)
max_depth_vals <- c(1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10)
nrounds_vals <- c(10, 20, 50, 100)
pm25_aod_xgb_params <- expand.grid(eta = eta_vals, max_depth = max_depth_vals, nrounds = nrounds_vals)


# Empty (filled later) vectors of RMSE and R2 values for each xgboost
pm25_aod_xgb_RMSE <- rep(NA, times = nrow(pm25_aod_xgb_params))
pm25_aod_xgb_R2 <- rep(NA, times = nrow(pm25_aod_xgb_params))

for(i in 1:nrow(pm25_aod_xgb_params)){
  # Get collection of parameters
  eta = pm25_aod_xgb_params[i, "eta"]
  max_depth = pm25_aod_xgb_params[i, "max_depth"]
  nrounds = pm25_aod_xgb_params[i, "nrounds"]
  
  # Fit xgboost model with given parameters
  PM25_AOD_xgb <- xgboost(data = as.matrix(PM25_AOD.train)[,2:9], label = as.matrix(PM25_AOD.train)[,1],
                          eta = eta, max_depth = max_depth, nrounds = nrounds, verbose = 0)
  
  # Predict values for the test set with the xgboost model
  PM25_AOD_xgb_pred <- predict(PM25_AOD_xgb, newdata = as.matrix(PM25_AOD.test)[,2:9])
  # Compute RMSE and R2 of data on the test dataset
  pm25_aod_xgb_RMSE[i] <- caret::RMSE(PM25_AOD_xgb_pred, PM25_AOD.test$PM25)
  pm25_aod_xgb_R2[i] <- caret::R2(PM25_AOD_xgb_pred, PM25_AOD.test$PM25)
}

pm25_aod_xgb_table <- cbind(pm25_aod_xgb_params, RMSE = pm25_aod_xgb_RMSE, R2 = pm25_aod_xgb_R2)

knitr::kable(pm25_aod_xgb_table, row.names = FALSE, 
             caption = paste0("Model Performance of xgboost models on the test dataset", 
                              "<br>", "Model: Predicting PM2.5 using AOD")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"),
                fixed_thead = TRUE) %>%
  scroll_box(height = '500px')
```

Of the 96 xgboost models which we fitted as seen in the table above, the lowest RMSE among the 96 models was `r min(pm25_aod_xgb_RMSE)`, and the highest R2 value among these models was `r max(pm25_aod_xgb_R2)`.

Coincidentally, the xgboost model which attained the lowest RMSE was also the xgboost model which attained the highest R2 value. This model had the parameters `eta = 0.6`, `max_depth = 10`, and `nrounds = 100`, which were all the highest values used for these respective variables.
