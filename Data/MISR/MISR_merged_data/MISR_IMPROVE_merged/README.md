This is a sub-folder which contains MISR data that has been spatially and temporally matched with Speciation data from the IMPROVE dataset.

The spatial matching is restricted to any IMPROVE data sites which are within 2.2 km of an observation in the MISR dataset, and the
temporal matching is restriced to measurements which are taken on the same day.
