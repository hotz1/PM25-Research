This is a sub-folder which contains MISR data that has been spatially and temporally matched with PM2.5 data from the AQS dataset.

The spatial matching is restricted to any AQS data sites which are within 2.2 km of an observation in the MISR dataset, and the
temporal matching is restriced to measurements which are taken on the same day.
