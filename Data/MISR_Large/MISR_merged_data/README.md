This is a sub-folder in the MISR data directory which will store datasets which are comprised of MISR data that is spatially 
(and temporally) matched with PM2.5 and Speciation data from the AQS, CSN, and IMPROVE datasets.

The spatial matching is restricted to any data sites which are within 2.2 km of an observation (pixel) in the MISR dataset, and the
temporal matching is restriced to measurements which are taken on the same day in both datasets.
